1. Requirements Specification: We need to develop a guessing game, where the user attempts to guess a number between 1 and 10 which was randomly generated by the computer. The message displayed to the user after the guess will depend on how close the user's guess was to the generated number.

2. System analysis: the measure of how close the user is to the actual input is determined by the absolute value of the difference between the user's guess and the randomly generated integer.

3. System design: First, we will import random and, from math, fabs. Then we will print messages that explain the game to the user, after which we will generate a random number using random.int(). Next, we will prompt the user for an input of an integer between 1 and 10. an if-else-if statement will then determine which of the required messages will be printed, based on how close the user's guess was.

4. Testing: We will repeatedly test the number 5, since the random number generated will eventually sweep out all possibilities: we will use this to determine whether each of the components of the if-else-if statements are working. We note that if the range was expanded, this would be an inefficient mode of testing.
