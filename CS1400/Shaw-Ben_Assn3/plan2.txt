1. Requirements Specification: We must create a program which determines whether two people are in one another's personal spaces. It should also tell us whether the personal spaces overlap or if one is contained inside of another.

2. System analysis: let rs be the larger personal space, let rb be the smaller, and let d be the distance (it is also possible that rs = rb). if d>rs, there is no personal space issue. if rs >= d > rb, one person's space is being invaded while the other's personal space is not. If rb >= d, both personal spaces are being invaded. If d > rs + rb, the spaces are not overlapping. if rs + rb >= d > rs -2*rb, the spaces are overlapping. if rs - 2*rb >= d, the smaller space is entirely inside of the larger space.

3. System design: The analysis of this system is more simple by designating one person to have the larger personal space, as described above. We will print the intro message and prompt user inputs. We will compute the distance between the two people. Then we will determine which person is the "social recluse" and which person is the "social butterfly." We will then perform the person and space tests by means of a if-else-if statements, as described above. Then we will print the result.

4. Testing: We will test this by fixing the point between two people on the x-axis and varying the personal spaces. We will test all possible cases: 1. no intersection, no personal space violation; 2. intersection but no personal space violation; 3. social butterfly is in social recluse's personal space with overlapping spaces; 4. mutual personal space violation with overlapping spaces; 5. mutual personal space violation with one space contained within the other; 6. social recluse's personal space is violated and the social butterfly's space is contained within the social recluse's.
