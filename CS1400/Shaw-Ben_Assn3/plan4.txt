1. Requirements Specification: We are asked to simulate 100,000 nights of the zookeeper checking a single pen each night. Two elephants randomly select 1 out of 6 pens to sleep in, and the zookeeper randomly inspects a pen each night. The zookeeper claims that he sees an elephant 1/3 of the time, and that, of the times he sees an elephant, there are two 1/6 of the time. We will run a simulation to determine if, in the simulation, the zookeeper is correct.

2. System analysis: the values of the zookeeper, the first elephant, and the second elephant are integers between 1 and 6, 6 inclusive. They are randomly generated. if the values of the zookeeper and at least one of the elephants are equal, log this as an event in which at least one elephant is observed. Of these events, we select those for which the values of the zookeeper and both elephants are both equal and log these events.

3. System design: We will design this as a nested while loop. The outer while loop will loop while the user input is "yes". The inner loop will run as long as the count is below 100,001. If an elephant is observed, we will append the count number to an array A. When an elephant is observed, if both are observed, we will append the count number to an array B. len(A) / 100,000 is the percentage of times an elephant is observed, and len(B) / len(A) is the percentage of times two elephants are observed. If the percentage of the first event is within about 2% of 33.33%, and if the percentage of the second event is within about 2% of 16.66%, we will say the zookeeper was right. Otherwise, the custodian was right.

4. Testing: We tested our program with 10 iterations instead of 100,000 to ensure that the logic and percentages were correct (we displayed the results of all 10 nights).
